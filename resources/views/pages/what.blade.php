            <p>We mentor both male and female youth offenders 10-17 years of age at the Hays County Juvenile Center in San Marcos, Texas. We are involved with a youth mentoring program called <a href="http://www.ringofchampions.net/" target="_blank">Ring of Champions</a>. The mentoring encounter is gender specific meeting weekly with several time slots to facilitate the large number of offenders who desire a mentor. The extent of the program is dependent ONLY on the number of people who desire to establish one in their local communities nationwide. Prayerfully we strive for it to be a life-changing one-on-one encounter of finding faith and a life value system.</p>

                    <h5>Federal Systems</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">We are ONLY allowed to enter the federal system as visitors on an offenders approved visitors list. Federal law requires that all faiths be tolerated. Unit chaplains are unable to accommodate the requests of anyone who desires to volunteer for chaplain services for any faith. As a result, no visitor may carry a Bible, Koran, Torah, etc. No personal items may be on your person, including caps, studded clothing or any item that could be considered a weapon. Individuals are thoroughly searched, and electronically drug screened. We pray that the roadblocks to witnessing in the federal system will be taken down by prayer, obedience, and the will of God.</p>

                    <h5>TDCJ - Texas Dept of Corrections</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">TDCJ requirements are less restrictive. Perspective volunteers must apply through the Rehabilitation &amp; Reentry Programs Division in Huntsville, Texas. Applications can be downloaded here&semi; <a href="https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/php/volunteer_application/" target="_blank">Volunteer Application for the TDCJ</a>. The application is considered after a background check is run. The volunteer candidate is sent a letter with approval to proceed. Initial training MUST be completed at any unit listed in the letter before being placed on the approved master list in the individual unit requested for volunteer service. Individuals typically work through a church or faith-based organization such as Kairos.</p>

                    <h5>TDCJ - Texas Dept of Corrections - County</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">The County jail systems are run individually through the sheriff and the jail administrator. Background checks may be ordered or ministry credentials requested to authenticate individuals who desire to volunteer at chapel services or Bible studies. Be advised that each jail can operate completely different from one another due to local government. <em>NOTE:</em> Do not be discouraged by individuals who are not “friendly” with “faith-based” volunteers. Your strength, commitment, and perseverance in serving God will overcome the most stubborn obstacles.</p>

                    <h5>Texas Juvenile Justice Dept</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">Texas Juvenile Justice Department has undergone <em>MAJOR</em> changes in administration from it’s former organization, Texas Youth Commission. Volunteers must follow similar procedures to TDCJ to enable them to volunteer at the local units.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">County Juvenile Boot Camps are similar to the county jail system. The requirements are normally less stringent. The administrators are typically the Chief Probation Officer in that county. We have found extreme favor locally in our mentoring initiative.</p>
