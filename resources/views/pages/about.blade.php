            <p>As members of <a href="http://www.chariotsoflight.com/" target="_blank">Chariots of Light Christian Bikers</a>, we co-labor as partners and a parallel ministry to COL and <a href="http://www.jerrysavelle.org/" target="_blank">Jerry Savelle Ministries International</a> participating in its biggest soul-winning outreach in the nation.</p>
            <p>We have the unique opportunity to utilize a special ministry tool â€“ our motorcycles. We have seen many breakthroughs in offenders who had been previously unapproachable. The biker culture immediately breaks down the barriers that stop effective ministry from operating behind these walls.</p>
