				<p>As members of Chariots of Light Christian Bikers, we co-labor as partners and a parallel ministry to COL and Jerry Savelle Ministries International participating in the biggest soul-winning outreach in the country.</p>
				<p>We have the unique opportunity to utilize a special ministry tool – our motorcycles. We have seen many breakthroughs in offenders who had been previously unapproachable. The biker culture immediately breaks down the barriers that stop effective ministry from operating behind these walls.</p>

						<p>We mentor both male and female youth offenders 10-17 years of age at the Hays County Juvenile Center in San Marcos, Texas.  We are involved with a youth mentoring program called <a href = "http://www.ringofchampions.net/">Ring of Champions</a>.  The mentoring encounter is gender specific meeting weekly with several time slots to facilitate the large number of offenders who desire a mentor. The time and availability is dependant on each unit. The extent of the program is dependant ONLY on the number of people who desire to establish one in their local communities nationwide.  Prayerfully we strive for it to be a life-changing one-on-one encounter of finding faith and a life value system.</p>

								<h5>Federal Systems</h5>
								<p>We are ONLY allowed to enter the federal system as visitors on an offenders approved visitors list. Federal law requires that all faiths be tolerated. Unit chaplains are unable to accommodate the requests of anyone who desires to volunteer for chaplain services for any faith. As a result, no visitor may carry a Bible, Koran, Torah, etc. No personal items may be on your person, including caps, studded clothing or any item that could be considered a weapon. Individuals are thoroughly searched, and electronically drug screened. We pray that the roadblocks to witnessing in the federal system will be taken down by prayer, obedience, and the will of God.</p>
							</div>
							<div class = "item">
							<h5>TDCJ - Texas Dept of Corrections
								<p>TDCJ requirements are less restrictive. Perspective volunteers must apply through the Rehabilitation & Reentry Programs Division in Huntsville, Texas. Applications can be downloaded here. The application is considered after a background check is run. The volunteer candidate is sent a letter with approval to proceed. Initial training MUST be completed at any unit listed in the letter before being placed on the approved master list in the individual unit requested for volunteer service. Individuals typically work through a church or faith-based organization such as Kairos.</p>
								<p>County jail systems are run individually through the sheriff and the jail administrator. Background checks may be ordered or ministry credentials requested to authenticate individuals who desire to volunteer at chapel services or Bible studies. Be advised that each jail can operate completely different from one another due to local government. NOTE: Do not be discouraged by individuals who are not “friendly” with “faith-based” volunteers. Your strength, commitment, and perseverance in serving God will overcome the most stubborn obstacles.</p>
							</div>
							<div class = "item">
							<h5>Texas Juvenile Justice Dept</h5>
								<p>Texas Juvenile Justice Department has undergone MAJOR changes in administration from it’s former organization, Texas Youth Commission. Volunteers must follow similar procedures to TDCJ to enable them to volunteer at the local units.</p> 
								<p>County Juvenile Boot Camps are similar to the county jail system. The requirements are normally less stringent. The administrators are typically the Chief Probation Officer in that county. We have found extreme favor locally in our mentoring initiative.</p>
