						<p>We mentor both male and female youth offenders 10-17 years of age at the Hays County Juvenile Center in San Marcos, Texas.  We are involved with a youth mentoring program called <a href = "http://www.ringofchampions.net/">Ring of Champions</a>.  The mentoring encounter is gender specific meeting weekly with several time slots to facilitate the large number of offenders who desire a mentor. The time and availability is dependant on each unit. The extent of the program is dependant ONLY on the number of people who desire to establish one in their local communities nationwide.  Prayerfully we strive for it to be a life-changing one-on-one encounter of finding faith and a life value system.</p>
